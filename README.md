# Pet Parade (Patent pending)
A personal project to learn game development with our favourite companions.

You just went flat broke on that latest horse race. Denied the perfect prize winning poodle by the tribulations of your finances, but you've got a gumption to pamper every pet your town can provide; but I don't reckon this one will be a *walk in the park.*

## The Plan
Unsure of specific game engine to use at the moment. Likely will be unity or godot.

- Walks: After you pick up your furry friend you can meander around town as you please, some dogs will prefer a routine in time or specific routes. These routes can be plotted on the map for easy navigation around the neighborhood.
- House sitting: Come over to a clients house to watch the place and their little friends while they're out. Featuring far more animal types, each with differing routines.
### Features
- [ ] 3D walkable town
  - [ ] Navigation:
    - [ ] A map of the town with highlights for clients
- [ ] Pet preferences: can be provided by owners (such as what time to feed them) to ones that develop as pets become your regulars. The happier the dog is, the more you get paid
- [ ] Business upgrades: As the player progresses, they unlock new services they can provide (eg grooming, training, out-of-house sitting, etc)
- [ ] Pet unlocks: As one masters the way of the dog they maye expand their repetoire of skills to more animals such as:
	- [ ] Dogs
	- [ ] Cats
	- [ ] Rabbits
	- [ ] Snakes
	- [ ] Lizards
- [ ] Player items:
  - [ ] Personal house/pet office
    - [ ] Decoration Customization
    - [ ] Players can keep their own pets to return to
    - [ ] Outfits: Both for the pets and for the player.
